                Afterschool programs offer a range of activities for kids to collaborate in different areas. We'll start by giving entry quizzes to measure students' initial social skills. Then, they'll join our programs, trying various activities to challenge themselves. After completing the programs, we'll test their social development. We'll also gather feedback through surveys to improve future programs. We'll see how our programs affect children's social skills by analyzing quiz results and participation data.

                        We will analyze the importance of social development for children through extracurriculars and collaboration activities. How participation in these is crucial in the child's ability to collaborate, communicate, and resolve conflicts with peers. Showing what kind of success a child can have in life when social development skills are developed early on.

                    We are in the process of implementing a Joint Application Design (JAD) method to our approach. By applying JAD, I would ask children to share their recommendations after every activity to help us better understand their expectations. Also, I encourage parents and children to participate in some of the programs together to provide a better social development experience.
